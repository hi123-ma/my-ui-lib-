Hi and thank you for using my ui lib ik its trash but i will be updating it soon but i am making scripts rn so i cant update this wiki thank you for understanding
This is how to boot the library:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hi123-ma/my-ui-lib-/refs/heads/main/hi"))()
copy and paste this into your executor. This is how to create a button:

Window:CreateButton(MainTab, "Enable Feature", function()
    print("Feature Enabled")
end)

Window:CreateButton(MainTab, "Disable Feature", function()
    print("Feature Disabled")
end)


You can change the name to whatever you want.
